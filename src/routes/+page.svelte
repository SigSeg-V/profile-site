			<p>
				I'm a {myAge()} year old Rust evangelist with a passion for everything software: when I am not
				writing software at my day job, I'm writing it in my own time. I started back in 2015 wanting
				to mod a little known game called Call of Duty: World at War where I struggled for 3 hours on
				ugx-mods trying to understand how to replicate text on a screen. Since then software has continued
				to excite me and so I always take pride in making good experiences.
